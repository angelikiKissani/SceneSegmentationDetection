			3D Scene Segmentation & Detection

● Load stereoscopic images of scenes. Prefer scenes with large planar areas with large 
objects on them, such as cars. 
● Use the stereo images to generate disparity maps and convert them to point clouds (P1). 
● Apply denoising algorithms of your choice to improve the quality of the scene.
